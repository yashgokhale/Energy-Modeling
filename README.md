# Energy-Modeling
This repository contains modeling of Energy Demand, Supply, Generation and Systems, developed primarily at Carnegie Mellon University, as a part of my Master's course. I took up the following courses in the domain of Energy Analytics, Supply Chain and Process Modeling:
1. Data Science for Policy
2. Energy Policy & Economics
3. Process Systems Modeling
4. Energy Generation & Supply
5. Energy Storage System Design
6. Energy Transport and Storage
7. Data Management for Civil Engineers
8. Production & Supply Chain Optimization

CMU was a fantastic experience, which helped me grow professionally and allowed me to move into the areas of Energy Analytics, Policy & Optimization as an extension to my Chemical Engineering Background. If any of these projects interest you or you'd like to have clarification on either of these, you can get back to me at: yashsgokhale@gmail.com.
